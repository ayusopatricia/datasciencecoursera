Course Project - Getting and Cleanning Data
===================

This data come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals that were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise and the acceleration signal was then separated into body; and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz made by the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.

That data have been merged to obtain a raw data with the trainings and the tests results by activity (Walking, Laying...) and by the person in observation (anonymous).

Each variable have a descritive name as where t = time (captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz) and f = frequency, by 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The process output is tidy data in a TXT file with the average of every variable (as columns) by activity and subject (as rows).
